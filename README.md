# simon-maze
This is my game that I uploaded to my itch.io profile. It's based off of the classic game of Simon Says, but in the setting of a maze

Currently, this game is not visible in the unity editor. Game objects that were placed in the scene are not there anymore. Instead it looks like a new scene
I will continue working on this issue, I probably accidentally deleted an important file. In the mean time, the scripts and assets are still available to view, and can be placed in the scene if you would like to try. Thank you!
